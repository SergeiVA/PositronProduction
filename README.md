Positron production via radiation conversion

The code is to calculate positron energy sperctra produced by 10÷50 MeV electrons mooving along <100> axis in 10 mkm Si and 10÷40 MeV electrons mooving along <100> axis in 10 mkm Ge.

The hybrid scheme of positron source involving coherent bremsstrahlung in a crystalline Si and Ge targets (radiator) and subsequent electron-positron pair production in a downstream thin (about 0.1 mm) amorphous W target (converter) is numirically calculated. Computer simulation is carried out without taking into account positron energy loss in a thick converter.

The work was funded by RFBR according to the research project № 18-32-00922.
